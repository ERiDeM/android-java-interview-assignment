# Assignment exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises for Android and general programming in Java.

Originally, I created this repository to do per programming sessions with Android candidates in the company I am working.

# One problem per folder

Please open each exercise to have a better description of the problem, using the README.md file.

The problems are not solved in any place on this repository. Have a look to them, discuss with your team and try to solve them yourself before you interview somebody else.
